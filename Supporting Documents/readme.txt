README - A BETTER PACKAGE TRACKER SETUP AND USE

1. Install the .apk applications on your android device

2. Open a QR code generator at :https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/

3. Open the spreadsheet that contains the data at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N3ZPUKXh8E9IlL934UEaMOk6xLbDE7YiBSWQxP86IuI/edit#gid=0

4. Open the Loading App, and scan a custom QR code

5. Check to see that your custom code has been put into the spreadsheet on the "Loaded" tab

6. Open the Delivery Script at: https://script.google.com/d/1g6A0pWoP7PAP1TpjxXubBsc11Jebdh38Qm5i-3XgHZF_BxgNx8fhmmYr/edit?usp=sharing

7. Change the name of the package in the quotes on lines 10 and 27 to your package name (this is one of the coding errors unfortunately)

8. Open the Delivery App and scan your QR code

9. Check to see that your code has been removed from the "Loaded" tab, and placed into the "Delivered" tab with a timestamp

10. Open the User Script at: https://script.google.com/d/19GmPABgoJfwOf76lh97_DeTxvo8C1eLP0qJYQmKx5h6eK8ArI-L2_Rv5/edit?usp=sharing

11. Edit the 'e' variable in line 3 to the name of your package (this is one of the coding errors unfortunately)

12. Copy and paste the following into your browser, editing the 'XXX' at the end of the URL to the name of your package: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby1Vkdbj-dPDLCj_55V9fJmuz_ysUi6yzBlT7xBWv0/dev?sdata=XXX

13. You will see a message saying your package has been delivered with a timestamp. If you would like the coordinates of the truck, you can repeat from step 1, but skip steps 6-9

14. To update the location of the vehicle, open up Google Maps and find a location. Copy the coordinates, and paste them to the end of this URL, which you will put into your browser: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxSNhiaGjUna-hehgsgq5A32eGKCo_9496MDPQqJ2LL/dev?sdata=

15. You can confirm the location has been updated by referring to the "Current Position" sheet of the spreadsheet, as well as running the User App again
